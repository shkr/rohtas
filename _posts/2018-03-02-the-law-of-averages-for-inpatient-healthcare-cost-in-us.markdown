Just read this law online https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395ww Kind of explains why in healthcare, the market is anti-competitive. Not just not competitive.

CMS pays hospitals more if the average hospital cost for similar hospitals goes up.
To maintain “budget neutrality”
The law though is specifically about DRG and inpatient prices.
