# Projects
- project: pymc3
  role: contributor
  url: "https://docs.pymc.io/notebooks/bayesian_neural_network_with_sgfs.html"
  description: I contribute to the stochastic gradient algorithms module for scalable mcmc. PyMC3 is a Python package for Bayesian statistical modeling and Probabilistic Machine Learning focusing on advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational inference (VI) algorithms.

- project: noisy matrix completion
  url: "https://github.com/shkr/noisy-matrix-completion"
  description: After trying to solve missing data problems using some form of a tensor or matrix factorization technique, I figured it was worthwhile implementing my own library of different implementations. These algorithms are commonly used for building recommendation engines.

- project: (incubating) apache superset
  role: contributor
  url: "https://superset.incubator.apache.org/gallery.html"
  description: I have contributed to visualizations. I use it for data exploration and data analysis for my projects. It is an open-source enterprise-ready business intelligence web application.

- project: physician compare
  url: "https://github.com/shkr/physician-compare"
  description: Using a public dataset maintained by Center of Medicare Services (CMS) on every physician that accepts medicare. The data file contains key attributes about the physician and how they are employed in groups. I did a network analysis of the data to find out how physcians work together.

- project: naive bayes binary classifier on wikipedia articles
  url: "https://github.com/shkr/wikiclassifier/blob/master/wikiclassifier.pdf"
  description: multi-threaded training of a naive bayes binary word-category co-occurence classifier using akka streams. It trains on 10k negative and 3.4k positive html files in 30 seconds on a macbook.

- project: Bayesian linear regression
  url: "https://github.com/shkr/bayesian_regression/blob/master/clrm/results.pdf"
  description: Notes and code from my attempt to build 3 regression models with heavy tailed noise from a common RV, implemented using pymc3.

- project: RedditFlow
  url: "https://github.com/shkr/streams"
  description: Made this with <a href="https://akka.io/">akka</a>, it listens to any reddit comment feed via akka HTTP and processes it using akka streams. The output is persisted into an apache kafka queue as the sink.

- project: Dining philosophers and other multi-agent problems
  url: "https://github.com/shkr/actors"
  description: An implementation of the dining philosophers problem and other multi-agent problems such as shared ledger systems using akka actors, cluster with data persistence on <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">apache cassandra</a>
