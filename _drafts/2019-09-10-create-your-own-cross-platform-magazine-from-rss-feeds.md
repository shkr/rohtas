The information we collect about every topic, has an impact on whatever we choose to practice in
our lives. A news source today, has a general assumption of a mass medium. This is a specific situation, not necessarily
the definition of the form, type and content of how regular news must exist as.

When looking at my own consumption of regular news, I would majority spend time on mass media periodicals like 
ndtv, republic, nytimes, wall street journal (because I have lived in both countries). However, I later
found much more effective and relevant information when I started following regular bloggers. Given also
that I am a data scientist, I am a fond reader of blogs on statistics, deep learning and software engineering. So I 
have always been following blogs on those topics. But for information about politics, companies, goverments and social 
media, I would count on mass media publications to provide good quality and coverage. In order to tackle this weakness
I started using Inoreader, which kind of allows me to aggregate blog feeds. This was a big win, because I now had a
periodical - I had many many bloggers on many many topics on my inoreader feed so someone is always writing. The articles
were good quality now, and I also had sufficient coverage. I started using ViennaReader on my iMac and just inoreader
website on Ubuntu. On hackernews, reddit, emails, friends messaging, I have always found excellent articles that
I wanted to save for later. Often on difficult topics like Syrian war. Article 350, I have found some mass media publications
provide extensive analysis. They are often with open links, otherwise I find a good post online and email myself
using Zapier. This way I could complete articles on certain topics, by sendimg myself an email.

So when work gets busy it is difficult to find peace time and follow up on news which in my case is just
inoreader. This is the time I would get charmed into reading a mass media publication. That urge would come.
In order to counter that, I have started using OpenTickr on Ubuntu. It is great because it just keeps rolling 
artciles of your interest that you reminded yourself to read ongoing. When I feel like taking a break, I have that
thing rolling and just pick something to read. It will be interesting and relevant to my thoughts :-) 

There is no equivalent ticker for MacOS. So I built one. Here is the github repo so that you can install it.

I hope in this article, you have thought about why mass media communication in the manner that which you consume today
maynot be the most effective way to consume information. It takes a bit of effort, but you can get better quality
newsstream on your own. If you are not on the desktop. Inoreadr has iOS and Android apps.

Perhaps it would be a good idea to choose every author, and pick and choose what you read. Just like your food.
No manipulation.
